### Predictions with Scikit Learn

We performed our predictions with both our made-from-scrath RandomForestClassifier as well as with the one (and other classifiers) provided by Scikit Learn in order to check the differency in accuracy. The predictions made with Scikit Learn classifiers can be found in the `predictions` directory prepended with the string `scikit_`.

The Scikit classifiers used for the different datasets are as follows:

1.1) RandomForestClassifier
1.2) RandomForestClassifier
1.3) SVC
1.4) RandomForestClassifier
1.5) AdaBoostClassifier

All predictions made using our self-made RandomForestClassifier are named in the likes of `TestPredictions{N}.txt` where `{N}` is any number within 1-5.
