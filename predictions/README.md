# To run the code
- install the requirements for the project using pip
    + `pip install -r requirements`
- run `jupyter lab`


The project is set up into three parts represented by directories:
- part1 -> problem 1 files
- part2 -> problem 2 files
- predictions -> prediction files

It's important when executing code in a jupyter notebook to run the cells above it - most code toward the bottom of the files depend on code being executed at the top.  
  
In the root directory are the RandomForest classifier (rfc.py), Experiment (Experiment.py), and the polynomial and moving average models (predict_missing_values.py).
