# CSC 4980 - Intro to Machine Learning Project

[official project description](https://grid.cs.gsu.edu/zcai/course/4980-6980/homeworks.html)

## Highlights

### Part 1: Classification
We need to write an algorithm that can learn from a given previous sample set and their classifications, and generalize onto a new set samples to predict their classifications. We're given 5 sets of trainig data, the labels assiciated with the them, and testing data to predict. Submission should be a `.txt` file with each predicted value on its own line for everyday given testing set.  
    
Find the data in `/part1/data`.

### Part 2: Regression
Similar to part 1, except the target values we need to learn are continuous. We need to predict missing values in 2 datasets.   
  
Find the data in `/part2/data`.
